A browser (chrome) extension to automatically skip the explanations for "Introduction to Programming" and crowdsource solutions so only 1 person has to solve them! When someone completes an exercise successfully, the extension notices and uploads it to a database. When other people visit that same page, the solution is pulled and automatically submitted. Efficiency. Everyone at an unnamed university should install this.

## Extension

[Here]'s how to install a custom browser extension. The extension in this repo is in `./ext`, so only select that folder.

TODO:

* User can turn off / on auto mode, so they can read something if they want.
* Save solutions to non programming questions.
* Record the time people spent on programming exercises and tell people how much time they saved.
